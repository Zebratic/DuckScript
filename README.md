# DuckScript

A small tool allowing Windows users to easily make payloads to use for educational purposes. [Click here to download.](https://github.com/Zebratic/DuckScript/releases)

## Disclaimer
**Use at your own risk!** This tool is simple but powerful, and it can be used to make harm on other computers.
**I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO YOUR DEVICE!**

Works on Windows 10.

## How does it work?
It runs scripts specially coded for DuckScript, and it will execute all the functions told.

When starting, I recommened running the app with elevated permissions (Administrator) in order to be able to install the .duck extension.
This is also recommended if any functions or payloads needs elevated permissions (Administrator).

## Installation
To start using DuckScript, all you have to do is run DuckScript.exe with elevated permissions (Administrator) and then you can create a text file
and rename it to "whatever.duck."

All ".duck" files will launch DuckScript from anywhere.

You can also delete DuckScript.exe after running once since it gets installed to your Local Appdata, ready to use from anywhere!

Scripts can also be run manually by opening DuckScript.exe and inputting the specified path to the script. (make sure its a .duck file!)
